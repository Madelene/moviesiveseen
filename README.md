# MOVIESIVESEEN

My mom likes to watch movies. A LOT of movies. She also likes to keep track of the movies she's seen, so she doesn't accidentally watch the same thing twice. I thought to build her a Rails app, from scratch, allowing her to keep track of the movies she's seen.

Some info on how this app is built:

* Ruby version 2.4.2

* Rails 5.1.4

* PostGreSQL for production (Heroku), sqlite3 for development

* Run locally using `rails s` or view here: https://moviesiveseen.herokuapp.com/
